# Horiseon - SEO and Digital Marketing (Bootcamp Challange One) 

## Introduction 

In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible so that the wesbite would be optimized for search engines.

During this challange my goal would be follow customer request and go an extra mile by improving the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, by reworking the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

It is an on-the-job ticket, which means I will begin with a starter code that I need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development which is **accessibility**.
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, this challange acceptance criterias are the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Description 

The website


At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.


## Changes 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
